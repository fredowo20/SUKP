# SUKP
**A new approach to the set-union knapsack problem (SUKP)**

This new approach considers a static method where instead of being based on items as most methods are, this one is based on elements, where the idea is to choose elements and gradually complete items, which will be added to the knapsack only when all its elements have been chosen. The priority is based on aspects as the weight of the elements, elements that ideally are on several items and be aware of what and how many elements remain to complete an item and also give priority based on that.
